- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
There are some parts of Java that are similar to Python, but the way you implement and call lists as well as how you use imported classes is extremely different and feels more complicated. It took a long time to figure out the proper format for getting a random index of a list of strings. We knew what to do, but the formatting made it take much longer.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
