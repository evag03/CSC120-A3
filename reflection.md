- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
There are some parts of Java that are similar to Python, but the way you implement and call lists as well as how you use imported classes is extremely different and feels more complicated. It took a long time to figure out the proper format for getting a random index of a list of strings. We knew what to do, but the formatting made it take much longer.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Each language has its own particular requirements. Some can generate entire programs in a single line of code while for others that's impossible, and some are looser in what they want out of a single line of code than others: Python didn't need anything at the end unless you were programming a definition of a function, if/else statements, or loops; but Java requires a semi-colon at the end of nearly every line.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Programming a Boolean for our mirror words allowed the program to recognize when the mirror words needed to be switched into the chatbot's responses. We struggled for a while to figure out how to use an array for the transcript, since we were convinced that arrays couldn't be added to under any circumstances. Once we learned that we just needed to import ArrayList that immidiately fixed that problem. I'd highly recommend to someone taking the course that they really utilize psuedocode as they construct the blueprint, since psuedocode can eventually be incorporated into any language, no matter how new the language may be to you.
